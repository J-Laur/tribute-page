    <h1>Margaret Hamilton</h1>
    <h2>A  Pioneer  In  Computer  Science</h2>
    <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist, 
      systems engineer, and business owner. She was director of the Software Engineering Division 
      of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight 
      software for NASA's Apollo program. She later founded two software companiesâ€”Higher
      Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies
      in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>

      <p>Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, 
      and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term 
      "software engineering".[1] On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of 
      Freedom from president Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight 
      software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.</p>
